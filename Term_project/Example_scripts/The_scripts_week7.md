# Discussion Week 6: Continuing to write scripts

So by now you have the core function of your project figured out.  You may also have some pseudocode or code to string together the aspects of your project.

__Pseudo code__ what is it?

This the code before the code.  Basically you want to write out what you want your computer code to do in english before you actually code it.  This is a great way to organize what your program will do, then all you have to figure out is the code to implement your vision. Once you figure out your code the pseudocode will be the bulk of the comments within the script.

There is no right or wrong way to write pseudocode, and here is a tutorial on how to write pseudocode:

Today in discussion, you want to finish writing your pseudo code.  You should also figure out who in your group is responsible for writing the code that will replace each part of the pseudo code.

There is a folder on GitHub ```https://github.com/pceeb/UCLA_Spring_2019/tree/master/Term_project/Example_scripts``` that contains useful scripts that you can incorporate into your project.  

There is also a folder on GitHub ```https://github.com/pceeb/UCLA_Spring_2019/tree/master/Term_project/Example_data``` that includes example taxonomy data for the 'fishbase' like projects.

_Just as a final friendly reminder:_
Your projects should be able to run on Hoffman2.
