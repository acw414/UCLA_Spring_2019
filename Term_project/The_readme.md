# Discussion Week 5: Setting up the Term Project GitHub Repository and Readme

Since forming groups and finalizing projects in class (Week5 Monday), you have undoubtedly been thinking a lot about your Term Project. Many of you might be uncertain of how to proceed because you are still learning to program.  Fear not, you will learn a lot more in class and we will help you find out what you need to do in order to have a successful project.

This week in discussion you are going to think about the Term Projects at the broadest possible level -- this is also probably the most important level.  You need justify why you are making your project, and map out the steps needed to make your code (e.g. a flow chart of what needs to happen).

In the end it comes down to this, in order for people to effectively use your program they need to understand what it does, why it is useful for them, and how it works.

Your Term Project will live on GitHub and be available to anyone. Programs on GitHub live in repositories, and these repositories contain Readme.md files. Readme files are the advertisements and in many cases the manuals for programs. These Readme files typically tell potential users:

1. The name of the program

2. The authors of the programs

3. The purpose for writing the programs

4. What they need to have installed to run the program

5. How to actually use the program (e.g. the commands to run, how to access the help menu, etc)

You want your Readme to attract potential users, then convince them that you program is awesome, and show them how to use it.

Today in class, you will generate the repository for your class project, and you will begin to write your Readme.  It is likely that you will make a lot of changes and additions to the Readme over the next 5 weeks.  If you do not modify this document I will be concerned that you are not making progress on your project.

By the end of the day, you will have a repository with a name, the names of the authors, and an introduction that introduces the project, justifies its existence, and provides a rough description of the steps required to take an input dataset and transform it to the desired output dataset.  If you don't know where to start, play around on GitHub, and search for program repos that you can use as a template.

__Note:__
Your introduction will contain citations.  You will cite relevant programs or studies related to your project. You are free to use any citation style, but [Chicago](https://dal.ca.libguides.com/CitationStyleGuide/CSE) is a pretty standard format.
